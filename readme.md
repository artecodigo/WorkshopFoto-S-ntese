## Generative Sculptures
## 3D Modeling and Fabrication Workshop
### Introduction
Modeling and fabrication of Generative Sculptures through programs created in open-source environments (Processing and openFrameworks) with s373.net/x code libraries. In this module we will generate abstract sculptures of the participants as well as model, create and print volumetric shapes from sounds, cameras, sensors, generative algorithms. The module introduces abstract volumetric space (voxels), introductory concepts of creating three-dimensional solids, does not require any 3D modeling experience, and provides several example programs that generate models from gestures or digitized sequences of users, sounds, sensors and others. interfaces, generative processes. With these programs we will create Generative Sculptures in volumetric space and print them on a 3D printer.

### Objectives
Knowledge of voxels and three-dimensional polygonization techniques. Modeling 3D objects through sounds, gestures, cameras, generative algorithms.
Engraving and printing 3D models.

### Program
Space, the final frontier: what is computational abstract volumetric space. What is Voxel. Examples of Three-dimensional Polygonization Techniques. Installation and use of the s373.net/x ofxMarchingCubes and s373.marchingcubes code libraries for openFrameworks and Processing.
Analysis and use of example programs for Modeling Three-Dimensional Volumes with sound, gestures, sensors, cameras, generative algorithms. Creation of 3D portraits with the Eu-Abstracto application. (http://s373.net/folio/projects/eu-abstracto/)
Writing .stl files.
Clean and scale the .stl in Blender and prepare in Cura for 3d printing. 3D printing of objects created by participants.
